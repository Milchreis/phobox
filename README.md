# What is phobox?
Phobox is a small tool to extend your local picture storage with a bunch of connectivity features. 
It starts a lightweight server process, which you allows to access your pictures over a graphical user interface
or a REST-API. Moreover you can organize your files and create collections of the best photographs.

**I developed phobox to solve two main problems in my picture workflow:**
 - organize new pictures from camera to the correct directories
 - get a simple and fast access to the pictures on my smartphone at home
 - search for pictures

# Getting started
## Download
If you want to try phobox, you can download the jar file from github. Look [here](https://github.com/Milchreis/phobox/raw/master/bin/phobox-0.0.1.jar) for the last version. All versions/builds are saved in the [bin-directory](https://github.com/Milchreis/phobox/tree/master/bin).

## Graphical interface 
1) Start the program (double click on phobox-<version>.jar or `java -jar phobox-<version>.jar` in terminal
2) Set up the directory to your local pictures
3) Open a browser on your local machine or maybe a smartphone in the same wifi to the shown ip address
4) Enjoy your pictures 

## Commandline interface (maybe for raspberry pi or other headless systems)
1) Start the program with `java -jar phobox-<version>.jar [ARGS]`
```
usage: phobox
 -b,--backupDirectory <arg>   Sets the directory for backups
 -h,--help                    Prints this help
 -nw,--noWindow               Hides the application window for headless usage
 -p,--port <arg>              Sets the port for this application (default 8080)
 -s,--storage <arg>           Defines the main storage path
 -w,--watchDirectory <arg>    Scans this directory for new files
```

## Importing new pictures
Phobox reads the _phobox/import/_ directory inside your specified picture directory. Each new readable picture will
be processed. Phobox moves the files to the configured directory (if EXIF data exists) and creates thumbnails for
a faster display on remote devices. Additionally you can define another watch directory to listen for new files (maybe a ssh or remote directory).  

For small number of files you can use a upload function in the phobox front-end or the drag-and-drop area of the phobox window.

# Features

 - Browse your pictures on different devices in the same wifi
 - Creating albums
 - Upload pictures from remote devices in the same wifi
 - Password saved access
 - Languages: English and German

# My local setup
The following diagram shows the simplified setup of my phobox and raspberry pi. All devices are in the same wifi and get access of the
phobox by calling the ip address of the RPi.

# Requirements
Phobox is build on Java and just requires a JRE 1.8+. The jar file is a standalone application and runs with `java -jar phobox.jar`. 
The tool runs on the raspberry pi 3 with the Java ARM version great, too.

# Build
The project can build with maven and the goal `clean compile assembly:single`. For eclipse the run configuration is stored in `phobox.launch`.
